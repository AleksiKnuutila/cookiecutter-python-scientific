* Introduction
This is a [[https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/][cookiecutter]] template that reflects my current understanding of best
practices for making rapid python projects for scientific computing and research. 

Out of the box, this template will install a python 3.6+ package with numpy, attrs,
and docopt installed for command line parsing. 

* Use
To create a new project, run:
#+begin_src bash
OUTPUT_DIR=$HOME/Projects/my-new-project
cookiecutter gh:cookiecutter gh:gvoysey/cookiecutter-python-scientific -o $OUTPUT_DIR
#+end_src

and follow the prompts.

Then, install the project as follows:
#+begin_src bash
cd $OUTPUT_DIR
git init .
git add -A
git commit -m "first commit of my new project!"
make init
#+end_src

and run basic test coverage with:
#+begin_src bash
make test
make lint
#+end_src

* Features
This package supports:
- pytest / hypothesis
- org-file readmes by default
- test coverage with coverage.py
- pipenv integration
